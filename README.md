# A Visual History of Nobel Prize Winners

The Nobel Prize is perhaps the world's most well known scientific award. Except for the honor, prestige and substantial prize money the recipient also gets a gold medal showing Alfred Nobel (1833 - 1896) who established the prize. Every year it's given to scientists and scholars in the categories chemistry, literature, physics, physiology or medicine, economics, and peace. The first Nobel Prize was handed out in 1901, and at that time the Prize was very Eurocentric and male-focused, but nowadays it's not biased in any way whatsoever. This will be confirmed in this project.

My analysis aims to discover the following:

- Which sex and which country is the most commonly represented?

- When did the USA start to dominate the Nobel Prize charts?

- What is the gender of a typical Nobel Prize winner?

- How significant is the imbalance in gender? And is it better or worse within specific prize categories like physics, medicine, literature, etc.?

- Given this imbalance, who was the first woman to receive a Nobel Prize? And in what category?

- Which laureates have received 2 or more prizes?

- What are the age trends within different prize categories

- Who are the oldest and youngest people ever to have won a Nobel Prize?
